**Author**: Eli
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Time Estimates
For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

Name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____

## Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate? all day

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? slack

How often will you take breaks? hourly

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? create a plan

## Cooperative
Make a list of each parson’s strengths. 
Eli/ dedication, commitment
Tre/research, user my resources to solve problems


How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? communicate

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? getting more comfortable with full stack implementation

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? communication is key

## Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? communication, reach out to that person and create more opportunities to help them understand

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? communicate and let them know how we feel to resolve this

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? create a a plan to execute and adjust when needed
